# Data

**IMPORTANT NOTE**

> Unfortunately, we cannot directly provide the compiled dataset due to license restrictions by data suppliers. Those who interested in obtaining the data should request the discharge data for Rimbaud River as well as rain gauge records for the area Real Collobrier from the RECOVER research laboratory at INRAE (https://www6.paca.inrae.fr/recover). The data for the SAFRAN reanalysis is also available upon request from Meteo France.
> 
> We replaced all real data by random values in the `data_dummy.pkl` dataset for testing purposes.
